The political establishment in Iran is expected to face challenges with legitimacy after the deaths of the President and Foreign Minister. Meanwhile, the Iranian government held an emergency meeting, during which Iran's supreme leader named First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber as acting president and announced five days of mourning in the country. The crash has left Iran without two significant diplomatic figures amidst regional tensions.
